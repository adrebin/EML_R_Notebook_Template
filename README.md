# EML_R_Notebook_Template
An R notebook that serves as a template for converting data to EML format using EMLassemblyline.
Essentially an extension of https://github.com/EDIorg/EMLassemblyline/blob/master/documentation/instructions.md

### How to use:
1. Press "Clone or Download"
2. Press "Download ZIP"
3. Save files in the desired directory location on your computer
4. Choose the .zip file that matches the number of files you wish to upload. 
   For example, if you have three files you wish to upload, select 3_file_version.zip
5. Unzip the file by double clicking on it, and then open the .Rmd file with RStudio and follow the embedded instructions 

### Current issues:
- The editData() and edit() functions behave oddly with "NA" strings. There are lines of code to handle this, but unexpected behavior may still occur. The current solution is to open the template files in Excel or some other text editor to fix by hand.
